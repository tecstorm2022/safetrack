### Goal  üö©
Safetrack is a mobile application for remote monitoring of patients after they receive medical discharge, the application was done in Unity for the national Hackaton Tecstorm 2022.

### What we will offer üì¨
- Monitoring Patient Signs
- Receive alerts of irregular values
- Analyze Values in Augmented Reality

### Technology üë®‚Äçüíª

The app is done using:

 - [Firebase] - A non relational cloud database
 - [Vuforia] - A development kit for developing Augmented Reality Apps
 - [Adobe Photoshop 2022] - A tool for editing pictures
 - [Blender] - A tool made for creating and editing 3D Objects
 - [Figma] - A tool for developing high fidelity prototypes

### Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

- To run the project in the desktop the user only needs to download the source code of the project and use Unity 2020 LTS to open it (with preference the version 2020.3.31f1)

- To install the app on IOS you need a Macbook, and apple developer account and a Iphone

- To install it on a Android Device the user needs to download the APK file and install it manually.

### WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
